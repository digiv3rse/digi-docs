### Adding to MetaMask
Addresses in your MetaMask will work and be the same on both Ethereum and the DiGi Network.
However, to submit transactions to the DiGi Network you must add the network to your wallet. 

- First, open the MetaMask desktop extension
- Click on where it says **Ethereum Mainnet** at the top and click **Add Network**

- This will open a new window, then click **Add a new network manually** at the bottom

- Lastly, add in the configuration details listed in the network section [here](./network). Once saved, you will then be able to submit transactions on the DiGi Network.
