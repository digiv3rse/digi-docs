# Ethereum vs DiGi Network

---

DiGi Network harnesses the Bedrock release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is purposely structured to mimic Ethereum as closely as possible. 
Still, there exist slight differences in the behavior of the DiGi Network compared to Ethereum. 


When building applications on the DiGi Network, these nuances should be noted:
- New blocks are created every 2 seconds on the DiGi Network.
- The gas limit for a DiGi Network block is 30,000,000.
- [OP Codes](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#opcode-differences)
- [RPC API](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#network-specifications)
- [Tx Costs](https://stack.optimism.io/docs/releases/bedrock/differences/#transaction-costs)
