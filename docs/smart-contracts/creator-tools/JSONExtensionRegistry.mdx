##### JSONExtensionRegistry
---

This contract is an extension registry for any address or contract owned by another address to reference a theming configuration file on-chain to update their digiv3rse.xyz minting profile.

This contract is statically deployed at: [0x9e27d816ba115bf9d2b5d810ddedb950463a5fe3](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9e27d816ba115bf9d2b5d810ddedb950463a5fe3) on sepolia. We will deploy on further chains as needed and we use an open CREATE2 bytecode-based deploy scheme where anyone can deploy this hyperstructure to any chain as desired.

###### Updating your configuration
---


`function setJSONExtension(address target, string memory uri) external;`

Call this function to set the JSON extension for your own address or an owned target address. We lookup ownership first via`AccessControl` then the `owner()` function.

###### Reading your configuration
---

`function getJSONExtension(address target) external returns (string memory);`

This function gets the latest registered JSON extension file.

###### Checking your admin status
---

`function getIsAdmin(address target, address expectedAdmin) external view returns (bool);`

For front-ends checking for updates you can use the `getIsAdmin` function to determine if the ad.
