## Introduction

At DiGi, we are passionate about providing the best experience to create and earn onchain.
**Protocol Rewards** is a split of our the DiGi mint fee allowing:

- Creators to monetize their work
- Developers to earn from NFT mints and creations they facilitate

## Address

Rewards v1.1 is deployed at the same address on all networks.

0x7777777F279eba3d3Ad8F4E708545291A6fDBA8B

## Fee Split (Per Mint)

#### Free Mint

| Recipient       | Amount       |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Creator         | 0.000333 ETH |
| Create Referral | 0.000111 ETH |
| Mint Referral   | 0.000111 ETH |
| First Minter    | 0.000111 ETH |
| DiGi            | 0.000111 ETH |

#### Paid mint

| Recipient       | Amount       |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Create Referral | 0.000222 ETH |
| Mint Referral   | 0.000222 ETH |
| First Minter    | 0.000111 ETH |
| DiGi            | 0.000222 ETH |

**Mint Referral**: The platform that referred a specific mint of an NFT  

**Create Referral**: The platform that referred the creator to deploy the NFT collection. The creator is determined by the royaltyRecipient of the token followed by the funds recipient of the contract.

**First Minter**: Only for premints, this is the first collector to execute the premint. In a non-premint context, this reward is paid out to the creator of the NFT.


## How It Works: Creator

1. Creator selects the **"Free + Rewards"** pricing option when creating their 721 or 1155 NFT
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator opens up their edition for minting -- **that's it!**

The creator's total ETH generated from rewards is aggregated into an [escrow contract](https://github.com/digiv3rse/digi-protocol/blob/main/packages/protocol-rewards/src/ProtocolRewards.sol) and can be withdrawn at any time.

## How It Works: Developer

### Create Referral Reward

The create referral reward is paid out to the developer or platform that referred the creator to deploy their NFT collection using DiGi's contracts.

#### Creating an ERC-1155 Token with Rewards

The `createReferral` address is specified upon token creation.

```
function setupNewTokenWithCreateReferral(
    string calldata newURI,
    uint256 maxSupply,
    address createReferral
) public
```

### Mint Referral Reward

The mint referral reward is paid out to the party that referred the collector to mint an NFT.

#### ERC-1155 Minting with Rewards

```
function mintWithRewards(
    IMinter1155 minter,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 quantity,
    bytes calldata minterArguments,
    address mintReferral
)
```

## Withdrawing Rewards

Rewards must be withdrawn from the escrow contract, which the address can be found [in the readme](https://github.com/digiv3rse/digi-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-rewards).

```sol
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

Withdraw for another address directly.

```sol
function withdrawFor(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

```sol
function withdrawWithSig(
    address from, 
    address to
    uint256 amount, 
    uint256 deadline, 
    uint8 v, 
    bytes32 
    r, 
    bytes32 s
)
```
