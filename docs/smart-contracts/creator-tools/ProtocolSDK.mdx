##### Get started building with the DiGi smart contracts

The Protocol SDK makes interacting with the DIGI protocol easier by generating required transactions for our contracts.

### Features

1. Mint existing 1155 NFTs and gasless NFTs
2. Deploy new contracts and create new tokens
3. Creating a token for free (gasless creation)
4. Minting a token that was created for free (bringing it onchain)
